# Hadoop Ecosystem

## Manager

### [Ambari](https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari/Ambari-2.4.1.0/)

- management and query / files UI

### [Zookeeper](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/zookeeper/index.htm)

- keep track of information that must be synchronized across your cluster

### [Oozie](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_oozie/apache_oozie_introduction.htm)

**Orchestrating** your Hadoop jobs

- Apache Oozie is the tool in which all sort of programs can be **pipelined** in a desired order to work in Hadoop’s distributed environment. 
- job queuing, **scheduler**, bunble

### [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/documentation.html)

- notebook for hortonworks

### [Hue](https://gethue.com/)

- notebook  files/query UI for cloudera



## Hadoop Core

### [HDFS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hadoop/hadoop_hdfs_overview.htm)

- from GFS(google file system), store immense files

### [MapReduce](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/map_reduce/index.htm)

Map: key: value pair

Reduce: aggregate

### [PIG](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_pig/pig_latin_basics.htm)

- Pig introduces Pig Latin, a scripting language that lets you use SQL-like syntax to define your map and reduce steps.

### [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html)

- A fast and general engine for large-scale data processing"
- for data analyzing 

### [Hive](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hive/hive_quick_guide.htm)

- Distributing SQL queries with Hadoop

### [Sqoop](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqoop/index.htm)

- Sqoop is a tool designed to transfer data between Hadoop and relational database servers.

### [Hbase](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hbase/index.htm)

- HBase is a data model that is similar to Google’s big table designed to provide quick random access to huge amounts of structured data.

## External Query Engine

### [Drill](https://drill.apache.org/docs/tutorials-introduction/)

Joint query across nosql databases

- access to Hive, MongoDB, HBase

### [Phoenix](https://phoenix.apache.org/)

SQL driver for **HBase** that supports transaction. 

OLTP: fast, low-latency

### [presto](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_presto/index.htm)

- [docs](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/)

Distributing queries across different data stores.

- access to cassandra,  Hive, MongoDB, MYSQL, posrgreSQL, kafka
- combine data from multiple databases, as drill

### [Impala](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/impala/index.htm)

- Cloudera’s alternative to Hive

## External Databases

### [MySQL]()



### [cassandra]()



### [mongoDB]()



### [Apache Kudu](https://kudu.apache.org/docs/quickstart.html)



## Sreaming



### [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/)



### [Flume](https://flume.apache.org/documentation.html)



### [Spark streaming](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html)

- live/streaming data processing
- data unit: batch
- Processing continuous streams of data in near-real-time(storm can do it in sub-second latency, quicker)

### [Storm](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html)

- live/streaming data processing
- data unit: event
- Works on individual events, not micro-batches (like Spark Streaming does)
	- If you need sub-second latency, Storm is for you
