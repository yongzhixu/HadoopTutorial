## Server Check

```sh
sudo jps
```

> We use the 'jps' command to check if all the [Hadoop](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-hadoop/) daemons are properly running. This is a basic check to see if all the required Hadoop services are running or not before going forward with any Hadoop operations or any additional setups. 
>
> Daemons such as DataNode, NameNode, Node Manager and Resource Manager are all checked. And this command will report out all the daemons that are indeed running.
